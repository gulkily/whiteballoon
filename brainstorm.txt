when registering a new user, they must include a help request as part of the registration form

"is anyone down to do this?"
--> going/down/agree/etc
--> input date and time

what types of help?
--> join me for something? 
--> project-based stuff
--> looking for a referral e.g. photographer, mechanic, services, etc.

--> emotional help
--> fundraising
--> couch to crash on?
--> travel together?
--> petsitting, babysitting, etc.

second and third degree connections are better than randoms for e.g. rides etc.
