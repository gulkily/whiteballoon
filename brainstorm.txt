-------------------------------------------------

invite required

when you invite someone, you write their bio

when registering a new user, they must include a help request as part of the registration form

"is anyone down to do this?"
--> going/down/agree/etc
--> input date and time

what types of help?
--> join me for something? 
--> project-based stuff
--> looking for a referral e.g. photographer, mechanic, services, etc.
--> simple help like hang a picture, do the dishes?
--> emotional help
--> fundraising
--> couch to crash on?
--> travel together?
--> petsitting, babysitting, etc.
--> give me a ride to the airport
--> help me get a job

second and third degree connections are better than randoms for e.g. rides etc.

different sections for sensitive things:
--> help me get a job
--> double dates

art projects:

prioritize and filter by degree (when listing)
--> allow specifying degree when submitting a post: first, 1&2, all
