# Step 1: Solution Assessment (Optional)

_Read this file only if the feature is complex enough to require Step 1. Save the Step 1 document before asking for approval. Pause again after finishing until the user replies with “Approved Step 1.”_

## Objective
Resolve uncertainty when there are multiple viable approaches, complex trade-offs, or an unclear direction before investing in further planning.

## Deliverable
- Ultra-concise comparison document (≤1 page) located in `docs/plans/`
- Filename: `{feature_name}_step1_solution_assessment.md`

## Structure
- Problem statement (1 sentence)
- ≥2 solution options tagged sequentially (Option A/B/C/etc.) with pros/cons listed as bullets
- Clear recommendation with brief justification

## Guardrails
- Keep content at a high level; no implementation details, code, or verbose prose
- Favor bullets over paragraphs for fast comparisons

## Next
Save the document, share it for review, and stop. Do not create Step 2 until the user explicitly responds with “Approved Step 1.” If the user says they edited the file, re-open it before continuing with `docs/dev/feature_process/step2_feature_description.md`.
