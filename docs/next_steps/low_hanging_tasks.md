# Quick Follow-Up Ideas

1. **Mutual-aid invite system** – Build the invite tree visualization, filtering (by request status and degree), and a bulk import flow that auto-vouches known community members.
2. **Guided help requests** – Turn the curated “ask for help” scenarios (rides, referrals, emotional support, etc.) into selectable templates or a wizard before users can freeform post, helping focus community replies.
3. **Reference/vouching flow** – Implement reference letters + “vouch for someone” UI to keep onboarding invite-only and integrate letters into downstream applications.
4. **Login approvals & fingerprinting** – Enhance login to support social/cross approvals (peer, admin, or second session), client fingerprinting for auto-approval, and a half-login state; explore Dedalus-assisted sanitization for those flows.
5. **Per-recipient encryption** – Allow publishing packets encrypted with specific recipients’ public keys so sensitive updates stay scoped to chosen peers.
6. **Invite landing concept** – Prototype the “door opening” entry screen and image-based invites for an immediate aesthetic lift.
