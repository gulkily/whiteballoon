# Planning Directory Index

This folder stores every planning artifact referenced in the Feature Development Process. Files now follow a predictable layout so contributors can jump to the right plan quickly.

## Layout rules
- Create a subdirectory named after the feature slug (e.g. `docs/plans/request_action_menu/`) once an initiative has multiple related artifacts (Step 1–4, stage docs, checklists, etc.). Keep all related files in that folder.
- Keep single-file plans in the root `docs/plans/` directory using the `{feature}_{step}.md` naming from `FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` when applicable.
- Move superseded or canceled work into `docs/plans/archive/` with a short context note.

## Adding a new plan set
1. Pick a concise slug for the feature (usually the portion preceding `_stepX`).
2. Create `docs/plans/<slug>/` once you have multiple related artifacts (or expect a multi-stage effort), then place every related file there.
3. For smaller efforts, keep the single document at the root until it grows into a multi-file set.
4. Update this index when introducing a new folder so future contributors can find it quickly.
