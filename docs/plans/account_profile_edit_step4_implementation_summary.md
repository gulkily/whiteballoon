# Account Profile Edit – Implementation Summary

## Stage 1 – Settings route + template scaffold
- Changes: Added `/settings/account` GET/POST handlers with a shared context helper plus the new `settings/account.html` template to preview email + photo inputs (submit disabled for now). Profile page now links to the settings page, and base styles cover the new layout/avatar preview.
- Verification: Manually loaded the settings and profile pages in dev to confirm navigation and layout; no automated tests yet.
