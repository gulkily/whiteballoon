## Stage 1 – Adjust AI response text composition
- Changes: Updated the AI response message to summarize counts and point to Sources instead of listing every title.
- Verification: Not run (per AI_PROJECT_GUIDE). Suggested manual check: ask a question in Request Channels and confirm the reply is a short summary with Sources unchanged.
- Notes: None.
