# Chat Reaction Rendering – Step 4 Implementation Summary

## Stage 1 – Catalog reaction formats
- Changes: Searched the repo for “(Reactions:” and found the legacy format generated by `signal_import.py` and parsed inside `signal_profile_snapshot_service._REACTIONS_PATTERN`: entries look like `(Reactions: Luca ❤️, emil ❤️, Mateo 😮)`. Noted that names/emojis are comma-separated, optional spaces, and the block always sits at the end of the message body.
- Verification: Manual `rg "Reactions:"` scan plus inspecting a few messages on `/requests/30` confirmed the suffix pattern matches the regex above. (No automated tests run.)
- Notes: Malformed cases (missing closing parenthesis) weren’t observed, but the parser should fail gracefully—fall back to original text when the pattern doesn’t match.

## Stage 2 – Reaction parser utility
- Changes: Added `app/services/chat_reaction_parser.py` with a `strip_reactions` helper that detects the `(Reactions: …)` suffix, removes it from the body, and returns a sorted list of `{emoji, count}` records (ignoring malformed entries). Exported a lightweight `ChatReaction` dataclass for downstream use.
- Verification: Exercised the helper in a Python shell with real snippets copied from `/requests/30` to ensure the cleaned body and counts matched expectations. No automated tests run.
- Notes: Parser intentionally ignores name-level granularity for now per Option B; it simply tallies emojis so we can render compact summaries.

## Stage 3 – Surface parsed data in chat context
- Changes: Updated `_build_request_detail_context` to call `chat_reaction_parser.strip_reactions` for every serialized comment, replacing the stored `body` with the cleaned text and adding a `reaction_summary` list (`[{emoji, count}]`). This flows through to channel panes, detail pages, and any template that uses the comment payload.
- Verification: Loaded `/requests/30` and `/requests/channels?channel=30` locally to confirm comments now include `reaction_summary` (checked via browser devtools) and that the body text no longer shows the `(Reactions: …)` suffix. No automated tests run.
- Notes: Search/index payloads still contain the raw text; Stage 4 will handle rendering/summary output.
