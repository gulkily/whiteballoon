# Chat Reaction Rendering – Step 4 Implementation Summary

## Stage 1 – Catalog reaction formats
- Changes: Searched the repo for “(Reactions:” and found the legacy format generated by `signal_import.py` and parsed inside `signal_profile_snapshot_service._REACTIONS_PATTERN`: entries look like `(Reactions: Luca ❤️, emil ❤️, Mateo 😮)`. Noted that names/emojis are comma-separated, optional spaces, and the block always sits at the end of the message body.
- Verification: Manual `rg "Reactions:"` scan plus inspecting a few messages on `/requests/30` confirmed the suffix pattern matches the regex above. (No automated tests run.)
- Notes: Malformed cases (missing closing parenthesis) weren’t observed, but the parser should fail gracefully—fall back to original text when the pattern doesn’t match.
