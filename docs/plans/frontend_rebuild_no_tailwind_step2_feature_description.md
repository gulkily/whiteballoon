# Modular Frontend Foundation â€“ Feature Description

- **Problem**: Stand up a new repository that implements a modular FastAPI core with authentication plus a request feed, delivering a custom-styled frontend without third-party CSS frameworks.
- **User stories**:
  - As a returning community member, I want to authenticate with familiar flows so that I can access my requests without friction.
  - As an administrator, I want to review and complete user requests from a clean interface so that operations stay efficient.
  - As a frontend developer, I want a lightweight template and CSS system so that I can build additional modules without fighting external frameworks.
  - As a backend engineer, I want module boundaries defined from day one so that future capabilities plug in cleanly.
- **Core requirements**:
  - Implement a FastAPI project with authentication, session tracking, and CRUD operations for a help/request feed.
  - Establish a vanilla CSS design system (tokens, layout primitives, components) shared across templates.
  - Provide HTMX-friendly templates for auth flows and request management without relying on Tailwind or other frameworks.
  - Document how future modules register routes, services, templates, and static assets.
  - Ship developer tooling (Typer CLI, tests) that encourages modular extensions.
- **User flow**:
  1. User lands on the home page and is prompted to log in or register.
  2. After signing in, the user sees the request feed rendered with the custom CSS system.
  3. User creates or completes requests via HTMX-enhanced forms; updates appear instantly in the feed.
  4. Admins access additional controls (e.g., visibility toggles) exposed by the same module pattern.
- **Success criteria**:
  - Core authentication and request feed features work end-to-end with FastAPI, SQLModel, and Jinja templates.
  - Frontend ships using only our custom CSS assets and HTMX for interactivity.
  - Documentation explains how to add future modules (directory structure, registration points, testing expectations).
  - Automated tests cover auth flows and request CRUD, providing a baseline for future module regression coverage.
