## Stage 1 – Inventory canonical data sources
- Changes: Reviewed settings in `app/config.py`, routing in `app/main.py`, and canonical docs (`README.md`, `docs/spec.md`) to determine fields and public routes to expose.
- Verification: Manual review of settings + route inventory.
- Notes: Confirmed sensitive fields (e.g., API keys) must be excluded from output.
