# Logo Tweaks — Step 1 Solution Assessment

**Problem statement**
- Existing text-only logo “WhiteBalloon” lacks a distinctive mark; we want a small icon/lockup that evokes community, buoyancy, and mutual aid while fitting the refreshed visual theme.

**Option A – Add a balloon-heart glyph + refined wordmark (preferred)**
- Pros: Minimal change; can be created with CSS/SVG; keep typography but add a simple floating heart/balloon icon.
- Cons: Requires custom SVG/letter tweaks; needs to stay legible at small sizes.

**Option B – Rounded badge logo (circle with initials)**
- Pros: Works well for favicons/social previews; straightforward to integrate.
- Cons: Might feel generic unless we add unique styling; more colors to manage.

**Option C – Full illustrated mark (bubbly scene)**
- Pros: Highly distinctive; matches “bubbly mutual aid” vibe.
- Cons: Higher effort; risk of clutter and mismatch across contexts.

**Recommendation**
- Choose Option A: craft a simple balloon-heart glyph to the left of stylized “WhiteBalloon” wordmark, keeping implementation minimal (SVG/CSS) while giving us brand personality.
