# Modular Frontend Foundation â€“ Solution Assessment

- **Problem**: Deliver a custom frontend for the new authentication + request feed core while keeping the stack lightweight and extensible for future plug-in modules.
- **Option 1: Plain CSS design system with utility classes and HTMX fragments**
  - Pros: Maximum control over styling; no build tooling; easy for future modules to consume shared tokens/components.
  - Cons: Requires careful documentation to avoid divergence; initial effort to establish consistent patterns.
- **Option 2: CSS Modules compiled via lightweight build step (e.g., PostCSS)**
  - Pros: Scoped styles reduce bleed between modules; enables future enhancements such as nesting or autoprefixing.
  - Cons: Introduces build tooling and dependency management; complicates onboarding for contributors who expect zero tooling.
- **Option 3: Adopt a minimal utility framework (e.g., Pico.css-inspired) and extend**
  - Pros: Fastest path to consistent baseline; small CSS footprint; semantic defaults are friendly to new modules.
  - Cons: Third-party conventions may conflict with custom module needs; overrides can accumulate.
- **Recommendation**: Option 1. Authoring plain CSS with a documented design system keeps the project dependency-free, makes HTMX partials predictable, and gives future modules a stable foundation without additional build steps.
