# Multi-Instance Sync Planning Checklist

Use this to track progress through the Complex Feature Process and handoff into the Feature Development Process.

## Complex Feature Process
- [x] Stage 0 Problem Framing (`*_stage0_problem.md`)
- [x] Stage 1 Architecture Brief (`*_stage1_architecture_brief.md`)
- [x] Stage 2 Capability Map (`*_stage2_capability_map.md`)
- [x] Stage 3 Implementation Playbook (`*_stage3_playbook.md`)
- [ ] Stage 4 Execution Log (`*_stage4_execution_log.md`) – commit once execution starts
- [ ] Stage 5 Postmortem (`*_stage5_postmortem.md`) – fill after rollout

## Feature Development Process
- [x] Step 1 Solution Assessment (`multi_instance_sync_step1_solution_assessment.md`)
- [ ] Step 2 Feature Description
- [ ] Step 3 Development Plan
- [ ] Step 4 Implementation Summary

## Implementation Tracking
- Keep Stage 4 execution log updated after each merged change.
- Use entries from the log to populate the Step 4 implementation summary.
- Defer coding until Stage 3 and Step 3 are approved/committed.
