## Stage 1 – Audit oversized modules
- Changes: Ran LOC + route-cluster inventory scripts. `app/routes/ui/__init__.py` totals 3,182 LOC with dominant sections: `requests` (~1,244 LOC), `invite` (~566), `people` (~176), `browse` (~131), `settings` (~130), `profile` (~62), `comments` (~59), `api` (~33), `root` (~24), `brand` (~12). `app/routes/ui/admin.py` sits at 1,202 LOC with ~1,076 LOC tied to `/admin` routes. `app/tools/comment_llm_processing.py` is 1,142 LOC spanning dataclasses (1–200), batching/planning logic (200–480), LLM clients (480–560), and CLI helpers (560+).
- Verification: Generated counts via small Python scripts (stored outputs in shell history) to confirm cluster sizing; no code behavior touched.
- Notes: Added inventory notes here for reference; next stage can scaffold packages named after the large sections above.
