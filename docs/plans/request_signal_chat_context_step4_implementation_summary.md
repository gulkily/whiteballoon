# Request Signal Chat Context – Implementation Summary

## Stage 1 – Comment search helpers & indexing hooks
- Changes: Added `request_chat_search_service` to tokenize request comments, detect topic tags from simple keyword dictionaries, and persist JSON caches under `storage/cache/request_chats/`. Hooked cache refreshes into the Signal import CLI and the comment creation handler so every request stays indexed automatically. Added a standalone `app/tools/request_chat_index.py` utility (wired through `wb chat-index`) so ops can rebuild caches on demand, optionally layering in an LLM classifier for selected comments without re-running Signal imports.
- Verification: (1) Ran a temporary Python script that seeded a user/request/comment, invoked `refresh_chat_index`, and confirmed the resulting cache file plus console output (`Generated entries: 1`, topic tags showed housing/transport/medical). Script removed the temp rows and cache afterward. (2) Created a short-lived demo request, executed `python -m app.tools.request_chat_index --request-id <id>`, and saw `[chat-index] Request <id>: 2 comments indexed (rule-only topics)` before cleaning up the DB rows and cache file.

## Stage 2 – Search API endpoint
- Changes: Extended the chat search service with reusable `search_chat` helpers (filters, highlights, anchors) and exposed `GET /requests/{id}/chat-search`, which enforces auth, accepts `q`, `participant`, and `topic` filters, and returns JSON results plus index metadata. Added DOM anchors (`id="comment-{id}"`) on each rendered comment so the client can jump to matches.
- Verification: Manual Python script created demo comments, ran `search_chat` with keyword+topic filters, and observed one result with matched tokens + anchor (`comment-####`). Script cleaned the cache + records afterward.
