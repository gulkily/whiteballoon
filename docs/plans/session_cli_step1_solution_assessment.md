# Session CLI – Solution Assessment

- **Problem**: Developers/administrators need to list and approve pending authentication requests from the command line (Typer CLI) instead of using the web UI.
- **Option 1 (recommended)**: Extend existing `tools/dev.py` with commands `session list` and `session approve <id> [--approver <username>]` that operate on `AuthenticationRequest` records.
  - Pros: Minimal surface area; reuses existing Typer CLI; easy to script.
  - Cons: Requires loading application context; must ensure cookies/session states remain valid.
- **Option 2**: Add a standalone script in `tools/` that directly uses SQLModel to query/approve sessions.
  - Pros: Keeps Typer CLI lean; simple to invoke.
  - Cons: Duplicates database logic outside CLI; inconsistent UX with rest of tooling.
- **Option 3**: Provide an API endpoint for approvals and use cURL wrappers.
  - Pros: Works remotely; consistent with web workflow.
  - Cons: Requires authentication; still manually craft HTTP requests; doesn’t reuse CLI.
- **Recommendation**: Option 1 – add Typer subcommands to `./wb` so administrators can list and approve pending sessions quickly with consistent CLI UX.
