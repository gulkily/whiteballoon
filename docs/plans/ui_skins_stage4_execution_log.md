| Date | Capability/Task | Code References | Tests / Verification | Open Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-14 | C1 (token inventory + base extraction + default bundle) | `static/skins/base.css`, `static/skins/default.css`, `templates/base.html`, `docs/skins/token_inventory.md` | Manual CSS spot-check, `./wb version` (CLI) | Still need to convert remaining literal RGBA values into semantic tokens before Terminal/Win95 skins. |
