# wb Completion Plan

1. Inspect how existing git completion is integrated (check bash completion setup and files under /etc/bash_completion.d or local equivalents).
2. Locate or design a wb completion script, ensuring it can be sourced by bash completion (potentially under completions/ or scripts/).
3. Install or configure the wb completion script so that bash sources it for interactive shells, and document how to enable it.
