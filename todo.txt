allow encrypting (publishing) packets specifically for individual/multiple clients (using their public key)

idea: entry page with a door opening
	invite could be an image instead of text

better login flow:
	add social/cross-login
		another user can approve
		another session from self user can approve
		admin can approve via command line
	add client fingerprinting to auto-approve future sesion
	add half-login state
	somehow use dedalus integration for this too? how?
		sanitize user inputs
		use user inputs as part of prompt

As admin, I want to see realtime or at least poll-updated status 
wherever I click a button that kicks off a process, such as Push/Pull, test dedalus
connection, etc. Please use FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md to 
just write a document standardizing how we do this.
