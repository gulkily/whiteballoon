allow encrypting (publishing) packets specifically for individual/multiple clients (using their public key)

idea: entry page with a door opening

better login flow:
	add social/cross-login
		another user can approve
		another session from self user can approve
		admin can approve via command line
	add client fingerprinting to auto-approve future sesion
	add half-login state
	somehow use dedalus integration for this too? how?
		sanitize user inputs
		use user inputs as part of prompt

add ability to promote a comment to a request
