allow encrypting (publishing) packets specifically for individual/multiple clients (using their public key)

idea: entry page with a door opening
	invite could be an image instead of text

better login flow:
	add social/cross-login
		another user can approve
		another session from self user can approve
		admin can approve via command line
	add client fingerprinting to auto-approve future sesion
	add half-login state
	somehow use dedalus integration for this too? how?
		sanitize user inputs
		use user inputs as part of prompt

sub-comments

surface most interesting/insightful/kind comments

extend comment LLM rubric to capture signals about the author
	aggregate them into auto-generated public profiles.
	be positive in the profiles only

user directory page

make sure auth required page is not just a json message
	members page
	check other pages
	make some kind of systematic update

when indexing chats, if a message looks like a request, spawn a new request for it

Log Dedalus-powered comment indexer runs (start/finalize) so they appear in /admin/dedalus/logs.
