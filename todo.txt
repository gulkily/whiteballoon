====

remove html strings from python strings
	and codify that this shouldn't happen

make the hub placeholder page look cooler

better handling of ctrl+c in both servers

make "share first request" field optional to reduce friction of registration process

get rid of "suggested message" which appears after invite successful

make register url prettier (no ? or =)

for each user, display full invite tree path just above them

allow encrypting (publishing) packets specifically for individual/multiple clients (using their public key)

enable users/operators to skin their own instance
	may need a refactor of the html/css templates

idea: entry page with a door opening
	invite could be an image instead of text

put each route in its own file
